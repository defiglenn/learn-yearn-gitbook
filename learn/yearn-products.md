# Yearn Products

![](../.gitbook/assets/yearn-products.png)

### Vaults

Vaults are capital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users do not need to have a proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy.

You can find the list of Vaults and their associated stats here: [https://yearn.finance/vaults](https://yearn.finance/vaults)

### Earn

Earn is a liquidity aggregator that shifts funds between [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), and [Compound](https://compound.finance/) automatically as interest rates change between these protocols. This product completely optimizes the interest accrual process for end-users to ensure they are obtaining the highest interest rates at all times among the platforms specified above.

### Zap

A tool that enables users to swap into and out of several liquidity pools available on [Curve](https://www.curve.fi/). Users can "zap" into the [y.curve.fi](https://www.curve.fi/y) or [busd.curve.fi](https://busd.curve.fi/) pools on Curve using one of five stablecoinsâ€”BUSD, DAI, USDC, USDT, and TUSD. Alternatively, users can "zap" out of these two Curve pools and into one of the five stablecoins mentioned.
